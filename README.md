# BlockSumoPlugin
### Alpha block sumo replica from bedwarspractice (bedwarspractice.club)  
For now made in a quick evening, will try and make it into a working and enjoyable game when I have time again

# Build
Use paper 1.8.8 & java 8  
This plugin should work in newer versions, except for the TextUtils.sendActionTextLegacy function which is made specifically for NMS 1.8  
Same as the rest, will try and make that working on every major version (at least 1.8-1.19, will see if 1.7 support is possible)
