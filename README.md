# BlockSumoPlugin
### Alpha block sumo replica from bedwarspractice (bedwarspractice.club)  
For now made in a quick evening, will try and make it into a working and enjoyable game when I have time again

# Build
Use paper 1.8.8 & java 8  
This plugin should work in newer versions, except for the TextUtils.sendActionTextLegacy function which is made specifically for NMS 1.8  
Same as the rest, will try and make that working on every major version (at least 1.8-1.19, will see if 1.7 support is possible)
### TEMPORARY EDIT: 
The only supported version as of now is definitively 1.8. There are a few more missing functionalities that I implemented with NMS for 1.8 only (BlockDestroyBlockPacket & ActionTextLegacy). I'll eventually try and add reflections, but for now deal with that.

# Additional note:
This was made with as few code taken from the internet as possible, mostly as training, hence why i'm not using any existing library for things like particles.  
Once this project is in a final state (working with most functionalities and without glitches), i'll see if switch over to proper libraries for some things.  
Also please PM me if you want to teach me to use Maven/Graddle
